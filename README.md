Normal flow

- create a branch for my new changes
- make some changes in visual studio
- when im ready and have a small, functional change I review the changes in github desktop
- I then add a title, description and "commit" those changes to my branch
- I can then create a pull request to merge my changes into the main branch when I'm ready
- After I should delete the branch to clean up after myself :)
