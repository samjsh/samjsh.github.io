        <h4>Hi! I'm Sam.</h4>
        <p>
          Welcome to my little corner of the web - and thanks for checking it
          out!<br />
          This for now and to come is a safe space for myself to share humble
          projects and conversations about my journey into tech.
        </p>

        <p>
          My own 'unorthodox' story began when I was working as a beauty
          therapist. It's what I had done straight after highschool but, the
          passion for it only lasted so long and I yearned for a complete career
          shift.
        </p>

        <p>
          *insert partner* For some time, I was really influenced by my
          partner's career in software development and at the same time of
          feeling like I was going through a quarter life crises, I had pondered
          for awhile about getting into IT. After some conversation and self
          encouragement, I began working away to create a plan. During this
          time, I didn't know if University was the answer but I thought that
          through networking at events around Perth first, that I would be able
          to get some valuable and first hand advice on what to do. That's where
          I discovered
          <i>She Codes Australia!</i> I booked myself a ticket for their One Day
          Workshop and a passion was ignited. That workshop changed the course
          of my career. I could do this. With some hard work and dedication, my
          dream wasn't so unattainable.
        </p>

        <p>
          The push for unconventional pathways into the industry continues and I
          am such an advocate for unorthodox.
